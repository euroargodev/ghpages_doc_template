# Introduction to markdown

Some dummy stuff to get you started with markdown.

## The Basics
We'll introduce you to the basics of standard markdown. 

### Line Breaks
To force a line break, put two spaces and a newline (return) at the end of the line.

* This two-line bullet 
won't break

* This two-line bullet  
will break

Here is the code:

```
* This two-line bullet 
won't break

* This two-line bullet  
will break
```

### Strong and Emphasize

**Strong**: `**Strong**` or `__Strong__` (Command-B)  
*Emphasize*: `*Emphasize*` or `_Emphasize_`[^emphasize] (Command-I)

### Headers (like this one!)
