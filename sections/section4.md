# Contributing to the documentation

## Suggest modification

The easiest method to suggest modifications to the documentation maintainers is to click the "Open issues" button at the top of the page to be modified.


This should take users to the documentation hosting repository where one of the templates can used:
- "Suggest Documentation change",
- "Report an error on the documentation"
